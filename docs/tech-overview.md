## Cutting Edge Technology: Fracture Point's Proof-of-Play Engine on Flow

Fracture Point replaces inflationary P2E loops with a **Proof-of-Play (PoP)** system — a gameplay‑anchored reputation and reward engine.

### Why It’s Cutting Edge

1. **On-Chain Behavior Sync:** Player achievements are written to Flow EVM as verifiable events.
2. **Hybrid Runtime Pipeline:** Unity → secure backend → Flow smart contract (gas‑efficient).
3. **Composable Economy Layer:** PoP feeds seasonal rankings, DAO rewards, Cadence NFTs.
4. **Non-Inflationary Earning:** Rewards funded by real revenue (ad tasks, passes, skins).
5. **Open-Source & Modular:** Contracts and docs are MIT‑licensed for community reuse.
